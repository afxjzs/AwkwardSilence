#AwkwardSilence

###Background 
I made this program for some people over at [/r/nfl](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl) who wanted music to play when the there was a break in the game they were watching.

The program basically starts the audio from a given sound source when all other sound sources are quiet and stops the given sound source when other sound sources are playing. There is user customizable tolerance levels and delays.

###Build
Requires the [cscore audio lib.](https://cscore.codeplex.com/)
