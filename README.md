#AwkwardSilence

###Background 
I made this program for some people over at [/r/nfl](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl) who wanted music to play when the there was a break in the game they were watching.

The program basically starts the audio from a given sound source when all other sound sources is quiet and stops the given sound source when other audio is playing. There is user customizable tolerance levels and delays.

###Build
Requires thee cscore audio lib
